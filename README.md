# Implementation-of-Logistic-Regression-Model-to-Predict-the-Placement-Status-of-Student

## AIM:
To write a program to implement the the Logistic Regression Model to Predict the Placement Status of Student.

## Equipments Required:
1. Hardware – PCs
2. Anaconda – Python 3.7 Installation / Jupyter notebook

## Algorithm
1. Import necessary libraries.
2. Load the dataset into a dataframe.
3. Create a copy of the original dataset.
4. Drop unnecessary columns(like sl_no,salary).
5. Encode all categorical columns using LabelEncoder.
6. Split the data into input features(x) and (target variable(x).
7. Divide the data into training and testing sets.
8. Initialize and train the Logistic Regression Model.
9. Predict the placement status using the test data.
10. Evaluate the model using accuracy and other metrics.

## Program And Output:
